# concurrent-programming

Algorithms and other things developed for Concurrent Programming class.

### Objectives

- Understand and implement concepts of **parallelism**, **synchronization between threads**, and **protection of critical regions**.
- Optimize program performance through concurrent programming.
- Develop distributed applications using languages ​​such as `GoLang`.
- Simulate real-world scenarios, such as e-commerce systems and file processing.

### Organization

The repository is organized by labs, each of which addresses a concept of concurrent programming:

- *Lab 1*: Introduction to **parallelism** with **file processing** in `Python` and `Java`.
- *Lab 2*: **Thread synchronization** and **concurrency control**.
- *Lab 3*: Calculation of **similarity between files** using concurrent programming.
- *Lab 4*: Concurrent implementation in `GoLang` for efficient processing.
- *Lab 5*: Building a Bittorrent-inspired distributed system using `GoLang`.
- *Lab 6*: **Producer-Consumer** distributed system using `Java`.
- *Lab 7*: Order processing in a concurrent e-commerce system.

### How to Run

Each lab contains scripts (`build.sh` and `run.sh`) to facilitate execution. See the individual directories for details on how to run the programs in different languages.
